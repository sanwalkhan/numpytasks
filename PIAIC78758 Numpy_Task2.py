# # CrunchieMunchies
# 
# You work in marketing for a food company <b>myCorps</b>, which is developing a new kind of tasty, wholesome cereal called <b>CrunchieMunchies</b>. 
# 
# You want to demonstrate to consumers how healthy your cereal is in comparison to other leading brands, so you’ve dug up nutritional data on several different competitors.
# 
# Your task is to use <em>NumPy statistical calculations</em> to analyze this data and prove that your <b>CrunchieMunchies</b> is the healthiest choice for consumers.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 

# # Task STEPS
# 

# 1.First, import numpy.

# In[1]:


# your code goes here

import numpy as np


# 2.Look over the <b><em>cereal.csv</em></b> file. This file contains the reported calorie amounts for different cereal brands. Load the data from the file and save it as <b><em>calorie_stats.</em></b>
# 
# 

# In[15]:


# your code goes here
file = open("cereal.csv")
calorie_stats = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=",")
calorie_stats


# 3.There are <em>60 calories per serving of CrunchieMunchies</em>. How much <b>higher</b> is the <b>average calorie count</b> of your competition?
# 
# Save the answer to the variable <b>average_calories</b> and print the variable to the terminal to see the answer.
# 

# In[19]:


# your code goes here
np.average(calorie_stats)


# 4.Does the <b>average calorie count</b> adequately reflect the distribution of the dataset? Let’s sort the data and see.
# 
# <b><em>Sort</em></b> the data and save the result to the variable <b>calorie_stats_sorted</b>. Print the sorted data to the terminal.
# 

# In[79]:


# your code goes here
calorie_stats_sorted = np.sort(calorie_stats)
calorie_stats_sorted


# 5.Do you see what I’m seeing? Looks like <b><em>the majority of the cereals are higher than the mean</em></b>. Let’s see if the <b>median</b> is a better representative of the dataset.
# 
# Calculate the median of the dataset and save your answer to <b><em >median_calories</em></b>. Print the median so you can see how it compares to the mean.

# In[25]:


# your code goes here

median_calories = np.median(calorie_stats)
median_calories


# 6.While the median demonstrates that <b><em><q>at least half of our values are over 100 calories</q></em></b>, it would be more impressive to show that a significant portion of the competition has a higher calorie count that CrunchieMunchies.
# 
# <b>Calculate different percentiles</b> and print them to the terminal until you find the lowest percentile that is greater than 60 calories. Save this value to the variable <b>nth_percentile</b>.
# 

# In[43]:


# your code goes here
nth_percentile = np.percentile(calorie_stats,4)
nth_percentile


# 7.While the percentile shows us that<b><em><q>the majority of the competition has a much higher calorie count</q></em></b>, it’s an awkward concept to use in marketing materials.
# 
# Instead, let’s calculate the percentage of cereals that <b><em><q>have more than 60 calories per serving</q></em></b>. Save your answer to the variable <b><em>more_calories</em></b> and print it to the terminal

# In[91]:


more_calories = np.count_nonzero(calorie_stats > 60)
more_calories


# 8.Wow! That’s a really high percentage. That’s going to be very useful when we promote CrunchieMunchies. But one question is, <b><em>how much variation exists in the dataset? </b></em></q>Can we make the generalization that most cereals have around 100 calories or is the spread even greater?
# 
# Calculate the amount of variation by finding the <b><em>standard deviation</em</b> Save your answer to <b><em>calorie_std</em></b> and print to the terminal. How can we incorporate this value into our analysis?

# In[51]:


# your code goes here
calorie_std = np.std(calorie_stats)
calorie_std


# 9.Write a short paragraph that sums up your findings and how you think this data could be used to 
# <b>myCorp’s</b> advantage when marketing CrunchieMunchies.
